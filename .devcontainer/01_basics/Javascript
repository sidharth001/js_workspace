Constants remain same throughtout the class
Variables can change anytime inbetween
There are three ways to declare variable in javascript:
1. let: this is used as scope issue is not there in it.
2. var: not recommended
3. Here without declaring anything variable we can declare but this is not at all recommended.
Normally we dont use var because there is problem of scope in it. 
Whenever we used to change any name or anything, it used to change at all the places.

Now in javascript if we left the variable undeclared, then JS considered the variable as undefined LIKE
let accountState
